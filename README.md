I'm a guitar player, body-builder, and geek. I have a wife and three kids. I enjoy shooting guns, especially while lifting weights and playing a guitar with my toes. My wife is also into bodybuilding, and we have romantic dates consisting of duct-taping our three children together and dead-lifting, or overhead-pressing them. 

Good to be here.
